🏥 Doctor Appointment App
A Simple, Secure Android App for Managing Doctor Information, User Profiles, and Health
This app integrates Firebase Authentication, Firebase Realtime Database, and Room Database to provide users with a seamless experience for managing their health and doctor information. The app also includes a BMI calculator and the groundwork for future appointment booking.

💡 Here's What My App Does:

1️⃣ Firebase Authentication:

Implemented phone number authentication for a seamless and secure user login process. 📞🔒

2️⃣ Doctors Information Management:

Used Firebase Realtime Database to upload and retrieve a JSON file containing detailed information about doctors (a cost-effective alternative to Firebase Storage).

Created a page displaying all doctors' details, ensuring easy access for users. 🩺

3️⃣ User Profile Page:

Designed a user profile page where users can upload and manage their personal information.

In the future, this data will be shared with doctors during the appointment booking process for confirmation. 🧑‍💼📄

4️⃣ Room Database Integration:

Incorporated local storage using Room Database to save doctors selected by users for offline access. 🌐💾

5️⃣ Appointment Page (Coming Soon):

Laying the groundwork for an appointment booking feature that will allow users to share their profile data with doctors. Excited to build and integrate this feature in the next phase! 📅

6️⃣ BMI Calculator:

Integrated a simple and efficient BMI calculator for users to monitor their health directly in the app. ⚖️

💻 Tech Stack:

Kotlin for development.

Firebase (Authentication + Realtime Database) for user management and doctor data storage.

Room Database for offline storage of user-selected doctors.
